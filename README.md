his project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset provided by the sklearn library. 
The goal is to train a regression model that estimates house prices accurately. 
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), and hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to ensure optimal model configuration through cross-validation.
